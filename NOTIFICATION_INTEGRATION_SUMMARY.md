## üìã Implementation Checklist

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Notification Types Definition
**File:** `/Backend/src/utils/interface.ts`

**Added Notification Types:**
- ‚úÖ `NEW_ORDER_ASSIGNED` - Agent receives new order assignment
- ‚úÖ `ORDER_IN_PROGRESS` - Customer notified when shopping starts
- ‚úÖ `ORDER_READY` - Customer notified when shopping completes
- ‚úÖ `ORDER_DELIVERY_STARTED` - Customer notified when delivery begins

**Existing Types Used:**
- ‚úÖ `PAYMENT_SUCCESSFUL` - Payment confirmation
- ‚úÖ `ORDER_ACCEPTED` - Agent assigned to order
- ‚úÖ `ORDER_COMPLETED` - Order delivered successfully

**Location:** Lines 124-129 in interface.ts

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Payment Verification Notifications
**File:** `/Backend/src/services/paymentStatusSync.service.ts`

#### Trigger 1: Payment Success Notification
**Location:** Lines 204-217
**When:** Payment confirmed via webhook or API sync
**Recipient:** Customer
**Priority:** HIGH

```typescript
await NotificationService.addNotification({
    userId: order.customerId,
    title: NotificationTypes.PAYMENT_SUCCESSFUL,
    heading: 'Payment Confirmed',
    message: `Your payment for order #${order.orderNumber} has been confirmed...`,
    resource: order.id,
    actorId: order.customerId,
});
```

#### Trigger 2: Agent Assignment Notifications (DUAL)
**Location:** Lines 129-154
**When:** Agent automatically assigned after payment
**Recipients:** Customer AND Agent
**Priority:** HIGH

**Customer Notification:**
```typescript
await NotificationService.addNotification({
    userId: order.customerId,
    title: NotificationTypes.ORDER_ACCEPTED,
    heading: 'Agent Assigned',
    message: `${selectedAgent.firstName} ${selectedAgent.lastName} has been assigned...`,
    resource: order.id,
    actorId: selectedAgent.id,
});
```

**Agent Notification:**
```typescript
await NotificationService.addNotification({
    userId: selectedAgent.id,
    title: NotificationTypes.NEW_ORDER_ASSIGNED,
    heading: 'New Order Assigned',
    message: `You have been assigned order #${order.orderNumber}...`,
    resource: order.id,
    actorId: order.customerId,
});
```

**Error Handling:** ‚úÖ Try-catch block ensures payment flow continues even if notifications fail

```typescript
if (status === 'shopping') {
    await NotificationService.addNotification({
        userId: order.customerId,
        title: NotificationTypes.ORDER_IN_PROGRESS,
        heading: 'Shopping Started',
        message: `${agentName} has started shopping for your order #${order.orderNumber}`,
        resource: order.id,
        actorId: userId,

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Resilience

### Payment Verification (paymentStatusSync.service.ts)
**Lines 151-154, 214-217**
```typescript
try {
    // Send notifications
} catch (notificationError) {
    logger.error(`Failed to send agent assignment notifications...`);
    // Don't fail the assignment if notification fails
}
```

### Order Status Updates (order.service.ts)
**Lines 957-960**
```typescript
try {
    // Send status notifications
} catch (notificationError) {
    logger.error(`Failed to send status change notification...`);
    // Don't fail the status update if notification fails
}
```

### Manual Assignment (order.service.ts)
**Lines 401-404**
```typescript
try {
    // Send assignment notifications
} catch (notificationError) {
    logger.error(`Failed to send agent assignment notifications...`);
    // Don't fail the assignment if notification fails
}
```

**‚úÖ All notification failures are logged but do not break the order flow**
